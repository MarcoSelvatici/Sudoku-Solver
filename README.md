# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku solver for 9x9 and 16x16 grids.<br>
In order to solve a grid you have to write it directly in the code as shown by the examples provided.<br>
Notes:
- if a grid is unsolvable the code will run for a while and then it will end without displaying anything.<br>
- the names of the variables are in Italian (since this code was one of my firsts).
